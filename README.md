Flutter Todo List is a completed to-do list application created for submitting to a job assignment. The application focuses on creative design UI and UX inspiration from  [dribbble.com](https://dribbble.com/shots/14064472-Note-Circle-Todo-list-app-home-add)  and is very simple to start using immediately.

Start the application by creating a to-do card by providing a title, color, and emoji. The card categorizes the to-do list for specific groups. Each to-do card has a progress bar that indicates how many to-dos have been completed. Tapping on the card, users can add to-do by writing in the text field at the footer. 

Tap on each to-do to get into the to-do detail page to view more details. Users can add reminders by local push notification, write more descriptions, and add more subtasks
